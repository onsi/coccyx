# Coccyx

Having trouble tracking down and dealing with all those Backbone leaks?  [Coccyx](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccyx) gives you two things to help avoid and track down leaks:
  - [TearDown-able view hierarchies](#teardown-able-view-hierarchies)
  - [Named Constructors](#named-constructors)

Coccyx is emphatically *not* a Backbone.js [framework](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette).  It is simply a set of Backbone opinions intended to help you deal with Backbone leaks!

There are two versions of Coccyx: an obtrusive version (documented below) that monkey-patches Backbone and an unobtrusive version (in case monkey-patching isn't your style) documented [at the end of this readme](#unobtrusive-vs-obtrusive-coccyx).

## TearDown-able view hierarchies

Views are only garbage collected when their reference counts drop to zero.  This cannot happen until all event bindings pointing to callbacks on the view are unbound.  Coccyx adds the `tearDown` method to all Backbone views.  When you're done with a `view` and want to make sure it is garbage collected, simply call

    view.tearDown();

This does the following things:

  - Remove any event callbacks bound via Backbone's `Event.on` or `Event.bind`
  - `undelegateEvents()`
  - Call `view.beforeTearDown()` (if such a method exists)
  - Call tearDown on any subViews (see "[Tearing Down SubViews](#tearing-down-subview-hierarchies)" below for more on adding/removing subviews)
  - Remove `view.$el` from the DOM

### Cleaning up Backbone event bindings

#### Cleaning up Backbone event bindings **only** works on Backbone version > 0.9.2.  If you have an earlier version of Backbone you **must** upgrade for Coccyx to work correctly.

Coccyx automatically cleans up any Backbone event bindings on `tearDown`.  To do this in obtrusive mode, Coccyx injects code into Backbone's `on` and `bind` methods to allow views to track which event bindings need to be cleaned up.

For this mechanism to work you *must* pass the `view` in as the context when using Backbone's `on` method:

    model.on('change', view.callback, view);

This has the added benefit that you do not need to remember to `_.bind(view.callback, view)`

You can enforce this convention by setting `Coccyx.enforceContextualBinding` to `true`.  Coccyx will then throw an exception if an event binding is attempted (anywhere) without passing in a context.

> **Note**: For performance considerations, calling `off` or `unbind` does **not** untrack the event binding.  To be clear: the unbinding will take place and the associated callback will no longer be called when the event fires, however the internal data structure that Coccyx uses to track which dispatchers need to be unbound during `tearDown` does not change.  This means that a reference to the dispatcher will exist on the view even after `off` is called.  This, ironically, will result in a memory leak until `tearDown` is called.

>To completely untrack an event binding you must call `view.unregisterEventDispatcher(object)` with the Backbone object that you called `on` or `bind` on.  `unregisterEventDispatcher` will automatically call `off` for you.

> Note that **only view contexts** keep track of dispatchers in this way.   You don't have to worry about other contexts (models, collections, whatever) hanging on to references to your event dispatchers.

> For the majority of use cases this proviso is a non-issue -- but [now you know](http://nerduo.com/thebattle/).

### Cleaning up DOM event bindings
Coccyx calls Backbone's `view.undelegateEvents` to clear out DOM event bindings.  Therefore, you must bind events using either the `events` hash or the `delegateEvents` method.

### Cleaning up other bindings
Views will sometimes have clean up work to do that Coccyx does not automatically handle.  A common example involves DOM event bindings that are not appropriate for `delegateEvents`.  In such instances you should add a custom `beforeTearDown` method to your Backbone view and do the cleanup there.  Coccyx will call this method if it exists.  Here's an example usecase:

    MyView = Backbone.View.extend({
      initialize: function() {
        this.boundResizeHandler = _.bind(this.resizeHandler, this);
        $(window).on('resize', this.boundResizeHandler);
      },

      beforeTearDown: function() {
        $(window).off('resize', this.boundResizeHandler);
      },

      resizeHandler: function() {
        ...
      }
    })

### Adding global tearDown handlers
Perhaps you have `beforeTearDown` code that is shared across all your views, but you don't want to, or can't, pull out this shared behavior into a common superclass.  You can register any number of callbacks to be called on each view upon `tearDown` by passing callbacks to:

    Coccyx.addTearDownCallback(function() {
      // do your own cleanup here
    });

the context (`this`) of the callback function is the view being torn down.  These global tear down callbacks are called right *after* the view's `beforeTeardown` callback. `Coccyx.addTearDownCallback` applies globally and, is therefore, rather smelly -- use sparingly and with care!

### Tearing Down SubView Hierarchies
The most useful aspect of `tearDown` is the fact that it will recursively call `tearDown` on all subviews associated with the view.  This makes it very easy to ensure that entire Backbone view hierarchies are cleaned up simply by calling `tearDown` on the root node of the hierarchy.

For `tearDown` to know what a view's subviews are you must pass any Backbone `subView`s to the `view` via:

    view.registerSubView(subView);

`registerSubView` returns the passed in `subView`

If you are removing a `subView` by calling `subView.tearDown()` there is no need to unregister the subview.  Otherwise you must:

    view.unregisterSubView(subView);

when removing a subview.  (You should rarely need to do this: `tearDown` is your friend!)

It is often convenient to be able to tear down all of a view's subviews, but leave the view itself alone.  This is commonly done in `render` methods that blow away all the view's content and then regenerate it.  You can tear down all registered subviews by calling:

    view.tearDownRegisteredSubViews();

## Named Constructors
Sick and tired of seeing `child` printed out when you console.log a backbone object?  This minor annoyance becomes a serious concern when trying to use Chrome's excellent [heap profiler](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/heap-profiling) to find leaks and analyze their retaining tree -- which of those many `child`s is the object you're looking for?

Coccyx solves this problem by providing the `constructorName` property.  Simple pass a descriptive class name in for `constructorName` to your Model, Collection, View or Router and see it appear on the console and in the heap profiler.  Since the heap profiler allows you to search by constructor name you can very quickly find objects of concern and make sure they are getting correctly cleaned up.

Here's an example:

    var AnimalModel = Backbone.Model.extend({
      constructorName: 'AnimalModel'
    });

    var dog = new AnimalModel({name: 'bagel'});
    console.log(dog);

    > â–¶ AnimalModel

You can enforce the use of `constructorName` by setting `Coccyx.enforceConstructorName` to `true`.  Coccyx will then throw an exception if a new class is crated without supplying a `constructorName`.

**Note**: Underscore's `bindAll` method works by iterating over all functions on an object and wrapping them in anonymous closures.  This includes the constructor function which means, unfortunately, that your object will lose its constructorName.  Best to avoid `bindAll` and actually pay attention to where you need to bind methods.  Alternatively... you could monkey patch Underscore...

## Testing Coccyx
`JasmineCoccyx.js` provides two custom Jasmine matchers to support test-driving code that uses Coccyx.  These are:

- `expect(view).toHaveBeenTornDown()` asserts that a view has been torn down.
- `expect(view).toHaveRegisteredSubView(subview)` asserts that `subview` is a registered subview of `view`.

Just be sure to include `JasmineCoccyx.js` in your Jasmine suite to install this matchers.  `JasmineCoccyx.js` works with both the obtrusive and unobtrusive versions of Coccyx.

## Unobtrusive vs Obtrusive Coccyx

**As of version 0.4** there are two versions of Coccyx: `Coccyx.js` and `UnobtrusiveCoccyx.js`.  `Coccyx.js` is obtrusive in that it monkey-patches Backbone to add [named constructors](#named-constructors) to all Backbone objects, [hierarchy management](#teardown-able-view-hierarchies) to all Backbone views, and [automatic binding tracking](#cleaning-up-backbone-event-bindings) to all objects that mixin `Backbone.Event` (this includes all models and collections).  All you need to do to reap Coccyx's benefits is `registerSubviews` and `tearDown` your existing Backbone views.

Obtrusive Coccyx (`Coccyx.js`) is the preferred version as it emphasizes that Coccyx is *not* a Backbone framework but rather a set of memory management opinions that should be applied and enforced across your entire app.

If, however, you prefer that Coccyx leave Backbone untouched you should use unobtrusive Coccyx:

### Using Unobtrusive Coccyx

Instead of including `Coccyx.js` include `UnobtrusiveCoccyx.js`.  Now only subclasses of `Coccyx.View` will be able to `registerSubviews` and respond to `tearDown`.

More importantly, only bindings to subclasses of `Coccyx.Model` and `Coccyx.Collection` (or any object that mixes in `Coccyx.Events`) will be tracked and automatically unbound when `tearDown` is called.  This means that it is **not** sufficient to turn your views into Coccyx views.  You must also convert any Backbone models and collections that views bind to into Coccyx models and collections.

Finally, in unobtrusive Coccyx, only objects that inherit from Coccyx support the `constructorName` property.

## Dependencies and "Installation"

Coccyx requires:

  - [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org) (duh) (tested with 0.9.2, requires at least version 0.9.2 -- Coccyx does not work with older versions of Backbone)
  - [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org) (tested with 1.3.3)

To use Coccyx you must include `Coccyx.js` or `UnobtrusiveCoccyx.js` *after* including Undersocre and Backbone.  

Future changes to backbone could break Coccyx or obviate its need.  If the latter happens - great!  If the former: let me know and I'll try to ensure compatibility going forward.
